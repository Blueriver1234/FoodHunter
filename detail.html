                            Frequently served with refried beans at Tex-Mex restaurants,
                            Mexican rice can often be pushed to the side (literally).
                            Here at Foodhunter, we think that’s criminal—when made right,
                            Mexican rice can be a fluffy, flavor-packed side that upgrades everything it’s added to,
                            from burrito bowls to taco dinners and everything in between.
                            Read on for all you need to know to make this rice the best it can possibly be.

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil <br>
                            2 carrots, finely chopped   <br>
                            1 small green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely chopped <br>
                            1 small yellow onion, finely chopped <br>
                            3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced <br>
                            2 c. long-grain rice, rinsed, drained <br>
                            2 tbsp. tomato paste <br>
                            2 1/2 c. low-sodium chicken broth <br>
                            1 (14-oz.) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, drained <br>
                            1 (8-oz.) can tomato sauce <br>
                            3/4 tsp. ground cumin <br>
                            1/2 tsp. dried oregano <br>
                            Kosher salt <br>
                            Freshly ground black pepper <br>
                            1/4 c. chopped fresh cilantro
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Directions</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Step 1
                            <br><br>
                            In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil.
                            Add carrots, bell pepper, onion, and garlic and cook,
                            stirring frequently, until onions are translucent, about 7 minutes.
                            Add rice and tomato paste and cook, stirring,
                            until grains are toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 2
                            <br><br>
                            Pour in broth, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce;
                            season with cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper.
                            Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low.
                            Simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked
                            through and liquid is absorbed, about 17 minutes. 
                            <br><br>
                            Step 3
                            <br><br>
                            Fluff rice with a fork. Top with cilantro.

                        <p>
                            Tomatoes are maybe the best part of summer 
                            (that’s right—better than the beach and late sunsets).
                            Usually our favorite way to enjoy them is raw with
                            a good pinch of salt or in a bruschetta,
                            but there is something incredible about grilling them.
                            <br><br>
                            Not only does the char from the grill add
                            a slight bitterness that balances a tomato’s acidity
                            and sweetness really well, but the direct heat manages
                            to bring some of the deep umami flavors that you might
                            find from a tomato sauce without letting the tomato completely fall apart.
                            <br><br>
                            You can season simply with salt, black pepper,
                            and oregano and eat as is, but we love topping
                            this with a flavor-packed tahini-Caesar dressing.
                            Place this on the table at your next BBQ next to a gorgeous
                            steak and some campfire potatoes, and you have a near perfect summer dinner.

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            TAHINI-CAESAR DRESSING <br>
                            3 to 4 oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained <br>
                            1/4 c. finely grated Parmesan <br>
                            1/4 c. tahini <br>
                            3 tbsp. (or more) water <br>
                            2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice <br>
                            1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper <br>
                            Kosher salt <br>
                            TOMATOES <br>
                            5 medium beefsteak or large heirloom tomatoes <br>
                            1 1/2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil <br>
                            1 tbsp. oregano <br>
                            Kosher salt <br>
                            Freshly ground black pepper <br>
                            Chopped parsley and shaved Parmesan, for garnish
                        </p>
                        <br><br>           
                        <h3>Directions</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Step 1
                            <br><br>
                            In a blender, blend anchovies, Parmesan,
                            tahini, water, lemon juice, and black pepper until smooth.
                            If dressing is too thick, add 1 tsp.
                            water at a time until desired consistency is reached.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 2
                            <br><br>
                            Transfer dressing to a small bowl or airtight container;
                            season to taste with salt. Chill until ready to use.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 3
                            <br><br>
                            Make Ahead: Dressing can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled.
                            <br><br>
                            TOMATOES
                            <br><br>
                            Step 1
                            <br><br>
                            Remove upper core and stem from each tomato.
                            Slice tomatoes in half horizontally and transfer to a large bowl.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 2
                            <br><br>
                            Drizzle oil over tomatoes;
                            season with oregano and a few good pinches of salt and grinds of black pepper.
                            Toss tomatoes to coat and let sit 10 minutes.
                            This will leach some liquid and allow seasoning to seep into tomatoes.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 3
                            <br><br>
                            Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (between 400° and 450°).
                            Grill tomatoes cut side down until charred and beginning to soften,
                            8 to 10 minutes. Flip and continue to grill until tomatoes are tender
                            but not falling apart, 5 to 7 minutes more.
                            <br><br>
                            Step 4
                            <br><br>
                            Transfer tomatoes to a platter.
                            Top with tahini-Caesar dressing, parsley, and Parmesan.

                            <br>                  
                            It’s an easy, quick dessert to throw together
                            <br>
                             and can be tailored to your tastes.

                        <p>
                            This Snickers Salad is so easy to make and has just five ingredients.
                            It tastes a sort of like a candy apple but with whipped cream
                            and chocolate thrown in. The texture from the Snickers with the
                            crunchy apple and the smooth whipped cream is heavenly!
                            It’s much easier to make than candy apples, too,
                            not to mention it’s easier and tastier to eat.
                            I used Truvia® Baking Blend in place of sugar to cut down even more on calories;
                            try it out if you’re looking to do that, too!
                            <br><br>
                            This is one of those “just throw it all together” recipes,
                            using more or less of certain ingredients as you like.
                            Sometimes more apple is nice so you’re still being “good”
                            while other times loading up on the chocolate and caramel
                            seems more the way to go. Snickers Salad is easily adaptable
                            so just go with what you like best; you’re sure to hit the mark with this one.
